#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# /Basic Mathematical Operations
'''Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
'''

#Solution:
# Basic Mathematical Operations
value1 = int(input("Enter the first value: "))
value2 = int(input("Enter the second value: "))
addition = value1 + value2
substraction = value1 - value2
multiplication = value1 * value2
division = value1 / value2
print("Addition: ", addition)
print("Subtraction: ", substraction)
print("Multiplication: ", multiplication)
print("Division: ", division)
